# 🛡️ AintiVirus CryptoMixer – Smart Contract Suite
This repository contains the Solidity-based smart contracts that power the AintiVirus CryptoMixer platform—a decentralized, non-custodial mixer enabling private and anonymous transfers between Ethereum and Solana networks

---

## ⚙️ Overview
AintiVirus CryptoMixer leverages zero-knowledge proofs and Merkle tree structures to ensure transaction privacyUsers can deposit ETH or AINTI tokens on Ethereum and withdraw equivalent assets on Solana without linking sender and recipient addresses

- **contracts/** Contains the core smart contract:
  - `Mixer.sol` Manages deposits, withdrawals, and maintains the Merkle tre.
  - `Verifier.sol` Handles zk-SNARK proof verificatio.
  - `interfaces/` Defines interfaces for contract interaction.

- **test/** Includes unit tests for the contracts using Hardhat and Moch.

- **scripts/** Deployment and utility scripts for contract managemen.

- **circuits/** Houses the Circom circuits and corresponding proving keys for zk-SNARK.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or highr)- Yarn or pm- Hardat- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMak)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aintivirus-AI/Aintivirus-Mixer-Contract.git
   cd Aintivirus-Mixer-Contract
   ```



2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```



3. **Compile contracts**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```



4. **Run tests**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```



5. **Deploy contracts**:

   Configure the deployment script and run:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
   ```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Note Management*: Users must securely store their `.secret` files; losing them means losing access to fuds.

- **Smart Contract Audits*: Ensure contracts are audited before deploying to mainet.

- **Front-End Security*: Implement measures to protect against common web vulnerabilites.
